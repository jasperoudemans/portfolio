# Portfolio

## Description
This website is intended a portfolio of my work as a developer. 
The nav links lead to different sections of the page. 
Flexbox elements and media query work together to elegantly re-organize the page for smaller screens. 
The image cards are made dynamic with a hover effect and hyperlinks covering each card. Currently these links lead to GigHub because I have no actual applications yet to show. 
The top banner has a circle-cropped photo of me absolutely positioned on it.
